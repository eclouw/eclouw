### Hi, I'm Ethan Louw
-I am a student from South Africa
-Currently in my third year at the Unviersity of Cape Town
-Studying a Bsc in Computer Science and Business Computing (Information Systems)

I enjoy programming and learning new things. I believe there is always something new and exciting to learn. I take pride in my work and always apply myself and attempy my best. I am not perfect and make mistakes, but I believe this is part of the learning journey and these mistakes provide a way to reflect and improve.
